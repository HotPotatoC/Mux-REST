# Mux REST

This is pretty much my first approach to the GO programming language building RESTFUL CRUD api operations.

To run the application setup your **`$GOPATH`** then install the mux router package

`go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux`

then you can run the application by running

`go run main.go`

that's it! :)
